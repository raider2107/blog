## Terminology  
CMMI is a collection of characteristics of effective procsses that provides guidance for improving an organization's procsses and ability to manage the development, acquisition and maintenance of products or services. It is a model, not a process. This model shows what to do, now how to do it or who does it. CMMI has to be applied rater than implemented.  
## Disciplines of CMMI  
CMMI for Development - provides guidance for measuring,monitoring and managing development processes.  
CMMI for Acquisition - provides guidance to enable informed and decisive acquisition leadership.  
CMMI for Services - provides guidance for those providing services within organization and to external customers.  
## Structures of CMMI

- Continuous - enabling an organization to incrementally improve processes corresponding to an individual process area (or set of processes) selected by the organization.
