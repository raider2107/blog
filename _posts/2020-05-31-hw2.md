Automotive Software Performance Improvement and Capability dEtermination (ASPICE) is a standard made by german car makers. It provides rough guidelines to improve your software development processes and to assess suppliers. 
It builds on the V-Model which means for every process from requirements to source code there is a corresponding test. The general idea is this sequence of processes:  

1. Eliciting requirements from the customer. Customer requirements usually are a mess. The challenge is to reject and negotiate to clean this up.  
2. Your project maps this into system requirements. This step is necessary to restructure customer requirements into a structure you can work with. It also provides a place to include requirements from other stakeholders.  
3. A system architect breaks down the requirements into logical services. This includes design decisions like what to do in hardware, what in software, where to run what, and how they communicate.  
4. For each software service, you derive software requirements from the system requirements. You can usually distinguish system and software requirements by their wording. Something concerning "the car" is a system requirement, while software requirements are often about input and output signals of services.  
5. A software architect breaks down the software requirements of a service into units. Since we focus on a specific device now, we must manage the available resources (memory, CPU time, etc).
6. We design and implement each software unit. This can happen in code or with more abstract models (usually of state machines) which transformed into code.  

This is the "left side of the V". On the right side the corresponding test processes from bottom to top are:
1. Unit tests for the design. Does the code match the design? Are non-functional requirements (like not crashing) fulfilled?
2. Integration tests for the software architecture. Does the composition of units into a service still work?
3. Software qualification tests for the software requirements. Does a service match its requirements? So far, there was no need to use the actual hardware platform since we only test the software.
4. System integration tests for the system architecture. Composing all the services into the full system, does it work?
5. System qualification tests for the system requirements. Does the whole system/car match the requirements?
6. Acceptance test done by the customer.  

In addition to these V-model processes there are also supporting and management processes. This includes stuff like archiving and having a plan.    
let us look deeper into the process where code is produced "SWE.3 Software Detailed Design and Unit Construction". ASPICE defines a set of base practices and this is roughly the list of questions an assessor will ask.  
- SWE.3.BP1: For each unit, do you have a detailed design which respects all functional and non-functional requirements?   
- SWE.3.BP2: What are the interfaces of the software unit?  
- SWE.3.BP3: Show documentation about the dynamic behavior of a unit!  
- SWE.3.BP4: How did you evaluate your detailed design for "interoperability, interaction, criticality, technical complexity, risks and testability"?  
- SWE.3.BP5 Traceability: Which detailed design belongs to which unit? Where is the unit in the software architecture? Which software requirements does the unit satisfy?  
- SWE.3.BP6: How do you keep code, design, architecture, and requirements consistent?  
- SWE.3.BP7: If you change design or code, whom must you notify and how?  
- SWE.3.BP8: Show me the code!      

A weakness of ASPICE is that an assessment only rates a single snapshot in time. If you assess a supplier that is good enough. To actually reap the benefits of doing it right, you must follow ASPICE from the beginning. There seems to be something about large projects or large organizations that spoils the incentives to do so.
