First lets explain the terms  
# Portfolio  
A Portfolio is includes all projects for an organization to meet their strategic business goals. This can be all projects for entire company or all projects for a division or business in a large corporation. It is a collection of projects, managed together in order to gain a business benefit. A portfolio doesn't really care about the implementation, all it cares is to achieving business objectives.   
# Programs  
A program is a collection of related projects that are dependent on each other and serve a common outcome. It is a subclass of a Portfolio. All projects within a program are related. Each project within a program, if executed separately, doesn't have that much value to the organization than what you get by doing them together under a program. Project in a program serve the purpose of common outcome.  
# Projects  
Project, helps organization to achieve a goal. Is a temporary endeavor undertaken with a specific start and end date, with an expected outcome of a Product, Service or Result. It is a subclass of a program.
