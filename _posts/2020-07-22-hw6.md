### [a]. The network diagram for above table:  
![net]({{site.baseurl}}/images/net.png)  
  
### [b]. All paths in the network diagram and their lengths   
PATH1：A-B-E-H-K LENGTH：2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 days  
PATH2：A-B-E-I-J-K LENGTH：2 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 14 days  
PATH3：A-C-F-H-K LENGTH：2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 12 days  
PATH4：A-C-F-I-J-K LENGTH：2 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 16 days  
PATH5：A-D-G-J-K LENGTH：2 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 2 = 15 days  
    
### [c]. Which is the critical path of the project? What is its length?    
PATH4: A-C-F-I-J-K is the key path of the project, and its length is 16 days.   
  
### [d]. What is the shortest possible time to complete the project?  
The shortest time is the length of the critical path, which is 16 days.

Input the information in Exercise 4 into Project2007 to generate a network diagram and task schedule, and find out the critical path and the floating time or time difference of each activity respectively. Print out the Gantt chart network diagram and task schedule. Write a short essay explaining the information contained in these diagrams to people who are not familiar with project time management.  
  
### Critical Path:  
  PATH: A->D->F->G->I->K->L    
  
### Floating time or time difference    
  
  ![ex2]({{site.baseurl}}/images/table.png)    

Total floating time = latest start time-earliest start time = latest completion time-earliest  completion time  
Early start date (ES): The earliest possible date to start an activity.  
Earliest finish date (EF): The earliest possible date to complete an activity.  
Late start date (LS): The latest possible date to start an activity.  
Late finish date (LF): The latest possible date to complete an activity.    
  
  Using Kanban experience:  
  In short, the Kanban method is simple in its core, flexible and efficient tool for workflow management. It allows you to organize and manage your process by visualizing every step of your workflow on a visual board called “Kanban board”.    
  Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.
